# MacroPad

The main external macro shortcut project.

Note: Is project is very slowly developed because it already fill my use case. But I project to add a mobile app.


## What is this? 

MacroPad is a project that allows you to connect multiple peripherals to a computer and use them to run shortcuts and macros.

## What is possible?

You can currently interact with:
- Voicemeeter
- OBS (experimental)

## Supported devices

### MIDI devices:
- AKAI APCmini
- Novation Launchpad Mini

## Contributions

For now I'm building the core of the project, so I'd like to make it all myself, but plugins and more supported devices are welcome.
